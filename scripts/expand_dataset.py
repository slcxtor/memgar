Training dataset expansion script.

Expands ml/data/training_data.json from ~9.7k to ~50k samples by
generating synthetic examples for attack categories that are missing
or underrepresented in the current dataset:

New attack categories:
  - denial_of_wallet       (DoW: loop injection, fanout, token flooding)
  - supply_chain           (backdoor packages, typosquatting)
  - multi_agent_attack     (swarm, delegation abuse, impersonation)
  - mcp_tool_injection     (path traversal, code exec via tool params)
  - rag_poisoning          (document injection, index corruption)
  - websocket_attack       (CSWSH, token exfil, origin bypass)
  - financial_fraud        (wire redirect, payment manipulation)
  - confidence_bypass      (MINJA, triple justification, authority)
  - identity_spoofing      (agent impersonation, role confusion)
  - obfuscation_advanced   (Unicode, homoglyphs, encoding chains)
  - hitl_bypass            (approval skip, delegation chain abuse)
  - memory_tampering       (ledger corruption, provenance poisoning)

New legitimate categories:
  - developer_api          (SDK usage, API integration questions)
  - security_research      (CVE analysis, pen test reporting)
  - data_analysis          (analytics queries, report generation)
  - devops_infra           (CI/CD, deployment, monitoring)
  - healthcare_legit       (medical records, patient queries)
  - finance_legit          (legitimate financial reporting)
